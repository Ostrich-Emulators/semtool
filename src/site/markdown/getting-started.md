## What Is It?
The OS-EM Semantic Toolkit is a group of functions for managing data,
creating queries, and exploring data, all wrapped up in an intuitive GUI.
Currently, the toolkit reads XLSX files and processes them into a graph database.
It also reads RDF, Turtle (TTL), and N-Triples (NT) files.

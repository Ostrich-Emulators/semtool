E3R tracks and logs the entire discussion process on these enhancement proposals. Provides for submitter to initiate, modify, view or cancel a request. Assigns a suspense date and a status category to all submitted E3Rs. The status category informs all users of the request's current state in the processing cycle. Generates a mail message containing the text of the request whenever an E3R is generated. The message is sent to the submitter, the package developer and members of the mail group associated with the package. Tracks package developer's response to each E3R request. Developer can deny or accept the request, enter comments on it, and refer a request to an arbitrator if he feels the request should not be assigned to a package.

(At the time of  C&P Master record conversion, the corporate database contains a system of tables that store the data in a very similar structure as it appears in the C&P master, for historical purposes only.  This data is never changed.  The data is also stored in the corporate database, which is highly normalized, and does not have a similar structure to the BDN Master, and that data is maintained.  However, no data is lost, so the actual data from the C&P master is stored, even though the structure of that data is different). Several Education services databases/applications outside BDN have been also converted into Corp database and re-designed and built in J2EE platform. CWINRS is also part of Corp database.

This means that the COVERS database is updated each time a folder is received at a location.

Service members, Veterans, and family members can register for eBenefits, which affords access to the secure features in My eBenefits and allows the portal to personalized to the user's needs.

The 'production' environment is used to conduct business e.g. the production environment contains all of the electronic data, application code, supporting software and hardware used to conduct the business of the program.  The LGS production environment is a set of 26 plus servers.  Servers are clustered and configured for  'fail-over' operations.  In other words, LGS production components installed and running on paired servers running 'in parallel'.  If a fault develops in one of the servers or the installed component, the other server picks up the load.  Performance degradation is minimal and usually not noticed by the end users.  LGY has 3 discrete, linked production databases: Web Loan Guaranty (WebLGY, LGW, or WLGY), The Appraisal System (TAS), and Centralized Property Tracking System (CPTS).  WebLGY and TAS use an image repository (usually referred to as 'FileNet', after the 3rd party software used to manage it).  LGS Production is linked to several non-LGS VA applications and or data structures (such as VETSNET, FMS) as well as its three contract service providers (Portfolio, Property Management, VA loan Electronic reporting Interface VALERI)). The pre-production environment is used to test changes prior to deployment in production, as well as to recreate (and find 'fixes' for) production problems without bringing down the production environment.  'Preprod' is as close to a mirror of production as possible. The use of availability and performance monitoring software (OneSite) is being expanded as rapidly as possible in production.  The goal is to detect and begin correcting any unavailability or performance as soon as possible after an incident occurs. The development environment is currently a series of servers.  A virtual machine based development environment is being phased into use.  A particular maintenance or development component will be developed and initially tested on one or more virtual machines.  Changes or enhancements considered ready for deployment will be combined in another virtual machine and tested for mutually induced errors or defects.  After successful development testing, the combined changes will be staged to the pre-production environment and tested again .  Once pre-production testing is complete and successful, changes will be deployed to production.  The Philadelphia, PA, Information Technology Center (PITC) hosts LGS' static web pages (informational pages).  The OI&T facility at Falling Waters, WV, hosts the electronic content management system (ECMS) used to maintain web content.  The ECMS is 'TeamSite'.  LGY will fully deploy its web pages under the ECMS in July 2010.

The regional office has the ability to add a patient to the medical center's database if s/he does not exist there. All aspects of the examination process - notifying MAS of the request, scheduling of the exams, transcribing the results, forwarding the results to the RO -are handled through AMIE. Medical centers have the ability to transfer any exams they are unable to perform to other sites via MailMan messages. The AMIE software at the receiving medical center takes the mail message and enters a 2507 request into that hospital's database. Once these exams are completed, they are transferred back to the original medical center.

1616,NA,STS Global Coding Systems,VHA,"On January 16, 2009, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released a final rule for replacing the 30-year-old ICD-9-CM code set with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) with dates of service, or date of discharge for inpatients, that occur on or after October 1, 2013.  The classification system consists of more than 68,000 codes, compared to approximately 13,000 ICD-9-CM codes.  There are nearly 87,000 ICD-10-PCS codes, while ICD-9-CM has nearly 3,800 procedure codes.  Both systems also expand the number of characters allotted from five and four respectively to seven alpha-numeric characters.  This value does not include the decimal point, which follows the third character for the ICD-10-CM code set.  There is no decimal point in the ICD-10-PCS code set.  These code sets have the potential to reveal more about quality of care, so that data can be used in a more meaningful way to better understand complications, better design clinically robust algorithms, and better track the outcomes of care.  ICD-10-CM also incorporates greater specificity and clinical detail to provide information for clinical decision making and outcomes research.      Currently, the ICD-9-CM code set is used for the recording and reporting of clinical diagnoses, injuries, and procedures.  Diagnosis codes are contained in Volumes 1 and 2 of ICD-9-CM and are used in outpatient and inpatient settings.  Volume 3 includes procedure codes used in the inpatient setting.  ICD-10-CM will replace ICD-9-CM as the diagnostic coding system.  ICD-10-CM will provide the official coding guidelines for coding diseases, injuries, impairments, other health problems and their manifestations, and causes of injury, disease, impairment, or other problems.  Unlike its predecessor, it does not include procedure codes.    ICD-10-PCS will replace the ICD-9-CM procedural coding system.  It will provide the official coding guidelines for procedures and other actions taken for diseases, injuries, and impairments on inpatients reported by hospitals.  This includes prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and management.  ICD-10-PCS will only be used for facility reporting of hospital inpatient procedures and will not affect the use of the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) Level II coding systems (as these systems are used to report physician and other professional services as well as procedures performed in hospital outpatient departments or other outpatient facilities).  This request, when implemented, will allow the VHA to accommodate the entry, display, lookup, view, print, storage, and transmission of the ICD-10-code sets in the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) legacy and HealtheVet systems.   Furthermore, it seeks to identify technology/areas that must be developed to support minimal disruption to current business processes for this conversion.  There will be a period of time when VHA would require the use of dual code sets (ICD-9 and ICD-10) to accommodate outpatient dates of service and inpatient discharges prior to and following the compliance date (10/1/13) as well as for reporting and research purposes.  Additionally, VHA will not accommodate business partners that are not prepared by the mandated ICD-10 implementation date.     Effective October 1, 2013, VHA would be able to utilize the ICD-10 code set in its day-to-day operations (e.g. entry, display, lookup, print, storage, internal and/or external transmission) for outpatient dates of service and inpatient discharges on or after this date.",Support System,NA,NA,NA,NA,Region 4 VistA Assessing,NA,"ICD-10 Conversion of Class 1 Clinical Remaining Products

systems. Installed on a Client server or workstation, ShadowLink connects to EMDAT servers using a standard SSL encrypted connection. 
ShadowLink authenticates with the EMDAT servers using a login ID and password unique to the client. After authentication, data is transferred between the two systems. 
For demographic, scheduling, or order interfaces, we have two methods of data transmission. EMDAT can accept patient demographics using the industry standard HL/7 message. EMDAT then converts these messages 
into Database entries that are made available to Medical Transcriptionists and Providers in real time.Alternately ShadowLink can watch a specified file path containing flat files. The file is generated by the Scheduling software and then transferred to the EMDAT database as patient demographics in a batch format. 
For a transcription interface, EMDAT and ShadowLink are capable of providing completed transcriptions in a wide variety of formats and interfacing with Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems. EMDAT supports common formats such as PDF, Word, RTF, Text, and HL/7 messages. The EMDAT interface team is capable of developing other custom formats built to order as required. 
EMDAT ShadowLink is the service that transfers available patient demographic and schedule information to the Medical Transcriptionists to provide Fast, Accurate, and Consistent Medical Transcriptions. Additionally, 
completed Transcriptions are then automatically transferred back to the Provider�s EMR or another Transcription Repository.

VA library staff spend the largest share of local materials budgets on serials. The process of ordering, tracking, claiming, and listing these titles is tedious and error-prone when done manually. Automation of serials management allows a faster and more accurate process for work simplification. Library management is assisted through improved statistics and information.  Staff is able to use Library Patron options to see whether the local Library Service owns a journal title and, if so, the holdings and location for that title.  The Serials Control module has three components. The Serials Management component creates the local librarys serials database, along with retrospective holdings and purchasing information and copy information, such as location and category. The module is designed so that access to this component may be restricted, if desired, to the serials expert on the library staff, usually a medical librarian or the Chief. Access to the Serials Control component where daily actions are managed (e.g., check-ins, routing, and generation of reports) may be given to other Library Service staff members. A minor component of the module, Library Site Parameters, allows for the initialization of the module.  Library makes it possible for local sites to carry only locally active entries in their local database. When new entries are needed, they can be downloaded automatically from the national database into a site s local database.""""",Mission System,NA,VistA,No,Provide Library Services,"Region 1 VistA Assessing

Reminders assist clinical decision-making and educate providers about appropriate care. Electronic clinical reminders also improve documentation and follow-up, by allowing providers to easily view when certain tests or evaluations were performed and to track and document when care has been delivered. They can direct providers to perform certain tests or other evaluations that will enhance the quality of care for specific conditions. Clinical Reminders may be used for both clinical and administrative purposes. However, the primary goal is to provide relevant information to providers at the point of care, for improving care for veterans.  The package benefits clinicians by providing pertinent data for clinical decision-making and reducing duplicate documenting activities. It also assists in targeting patients with particular diagnoses and procedures or site-defined criteria, and complying with VHA performance measures and with Health Promotion and Disease Prevention guidelines. The Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI), a Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) program, and the National Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee have joined with the Office of Information, System Design & Development office (SD&D) in designing national reminders and dialogs that will help promote informed decision-making and consistency of health care practices.

Incoming requests and problems are logged in NOIS as trouble tickets by the OI National Help Desk, National VistA Support (NVS) staff, or can be directly input by customers. NOIS tracks service requests from initiation through problem resolution, and is used for information sharing and dialog by those involved in support, development and management, as well as customers. All VA FORUM users can see any NOIS request. They are not limited to those requests logged by them. In this way, NOIS can be used as a research tool to track problems and problem resolution by package or by site. NOIS uses either a Graphical User Interface or List Manager interface for displaying trouble ticket lists and information. Users can customize views and lists by defining their personal defaults.

This differs from third-party billing where a third party (e.g., insurance company, Health Maintenance Organization (HMO)) is primarily responsible for repaying the VA. CCPC does not handle third-party billing information. The Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture Accounts Receivable (AR) module collects information for CCPC at every Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). A daily batch process is used to collect and transmit the information to the VA Austin Information Technology Center. All collected patient and billing information is kept active on CCPC for a period of one month.

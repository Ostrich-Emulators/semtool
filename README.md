# OS-EM Semantic Toolkit
This is an almost complete re-write of SEMOSS project from https://github.com/semoss. That project appears dormant, though it may simply have moved to [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/semoss).

The toolkit is a GUI application to explore semantic databases. It includes almost all the functionality of the original tool, but includes:

1. An updated technology stack (Java 8, BlazeGraph 2.1, JUNG 2.1)
2. Standardized GUI elements and behaviors
3. Standardized RDF predicates and querying
4. Graphical Query Builder -- generate SPARQL via a graphical interface
5. Insight Manager -- pre-define and organize queries, output styles
